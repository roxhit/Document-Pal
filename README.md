# Document-Pal
This is a Python application that allows you to have a conversation with
multiple PDF documents. You can ask questions about your documents, and the application
will provide you with answers based on the content of the PDFs.
I used python for backend development and data processing. Used Streamlit as web server
framework for its ease of use and rapid prototyping capabilities. I integrated with LLMs for
natural processing task and also integrated Langchain for blockchain based language
related functionalities.
